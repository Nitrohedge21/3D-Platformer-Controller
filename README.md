# 3D-Platformer-Controller
My poor attempt at recreating Sonic's 3D Gameplay in UE5.

16.12.2022 - Sonic Controller v0.2
- Added Jump Dash [WIP] (I can't figure out how to use multiple inputs for actions)
- Been trying to find how to check if the player jumped but no luck so far.
- Boost is still not good but the base is there.
- Tried to tweak a bunch of things in the code, based on the feedback I've received.

5.12.2022 - Sonic Controller v0.1
- Basic movement.
- Early boosting mechanic. Sonic is quite hard to control, gotta take a look at acceleration.
- Stomping mechanic.
- Will add jump dash as soon as I figure out how to use multiple inputs for actions.
