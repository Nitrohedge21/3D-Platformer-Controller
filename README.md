# 3D-Platformer-Controller
This repository is made specifically for a player controller that i'm working on for an assignment using UE5 C++. I don't know how to use Unreal with GitHub so I'll just put the code here rather than the project itself.

5.12.2022 - Sonic Controller v1
- Basic movement.
- Early boosting mechanic. Sonic is quite hard to control, gotta take a look at acceleration.
- Stomping mechanic.
- Will add jump dash as soon as I figure out how to use multiple inputs for actions.
