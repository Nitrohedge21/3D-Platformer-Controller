# 3D-Platformer-Controller
My poor attempt at recreating Sonic's 3D Gameplay in UE5.

5.12.2022 - Sonic Controller v1
- Basic movement.
- Early boosting mechanic. Sonic is quite hard to control, gotta take a look at acceleration.
- Stomping mechanic.
- Will add jump dash as soon as I figure out how to use multiple inputs for actions.
